Database-Analyzer
=================

A java Swing based Database Management Tool, to create a basic layout of your database (including relations, attributes, attribute types and functional dependencies). From this created layout you can get the current normalform of the database and each relation. Relations can be normalized into a higher NF, up to BCNF. It also includes a graphical representation of the database.
